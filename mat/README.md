# mat

A set of abstractions for sound spatialization in Pure Data based on a matricial representation of sound field.

- mat.2d.syn.brush~:  
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the cells of a matrix for a sound source using amplitude gains depending on coordinates.
- mat.2d.syn.bucket~:  
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the cells of a matrix for a sound source using variable delay lines without flanging effect.
- mat.2d.syn.spray~:  
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the cells of a matrix for a sound source using a quasi-synchronous granular synthesizer (QSGS).
- mat.2d.fx.eraser~:  
Help todo
- mat.2d.scope~:   
The abstraction displays the rms amplitude of the signals of the cells of a matrix inside a canvas.
- mat.2d.meter~:  
The abstraction displays the contributions of a set of loudspeakers in a space.
