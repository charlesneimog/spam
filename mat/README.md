# mat

A set of abstractions for sound spatialization in Pure Data based on a matricial representation of sound field.

- mat.2d.syn.brush~:  
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the cells of a matrix for a sound source using amplitude gains depending on coordinates.
- mat.2d.syn.bucket~:
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the cells of a matrix for a sound source using variable delay lines without flanging effect.
- mat.2d.syn.spray~:
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the cells of a matrix for a sound source using a quasi-synchronous granular synthesizer (QSGS).
