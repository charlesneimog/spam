# ylm

A set of abstractions for sound spatialization in Pure Data based on a ambisonics.

- ylm.2d.syn.directional~:   
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the circular harmonics of a source sound depending on coordinates.
- ylm.2d.syn.delay~:   
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the circular harmonics of a sound source using delay lines.
- ylm.2d.syn.grain~:   
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the circular harmonics of a sound source using quasi-synchronous granular synthesis (QSGS).
- ylm.2d.syn.ringmod~:   
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the circular harmonics of a sound source using ring modulation.
- ylm.2d.syn.flanger~:   
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the circular harmonics with a source signal using flanging effect.
- ylm.2d.syn.phaser~:   
The abstraction synthesizes the signals of the circular harmonics with a source signal using phasing effect.
- ylm.2d.scope~:   
The abstraction displays the weighted sum of the circular harmonics in a canvas.
- ylm.2d.decoder~:
